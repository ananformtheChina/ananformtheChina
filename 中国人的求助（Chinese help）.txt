I am Chinese, an elementary school student. I'm using Deepl translator to talk to you about this now. There is a very big problem in China, that is in China the government management is too strict, youtube, twitter, google and other websites are inaccessible, although vpn software like Nordvpn can solve these problems, but most of them need money, so I found an unknown permanent free vpn "F T.Q", the Chinese name 佛跳墙, but it is too slow, what is the recommended free vpn? (no free trial, permanent free)，Foreigners should not look（外国人不要看）：如果你是中国人，请使用deepl.com翻译
